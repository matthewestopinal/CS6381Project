# Simulator for Different Scheduling Protocols
Distributed Systems Final Project

To use: ```python simulator.py -o <output> -s <scheduler> -t <timesteps>```

Generates plots that match the baselines provided in the paper we studied so that we have metrics to compare to.

Here are the examples so far:

# Random Scheduling
